# Logistics Analysis

This project analyzes logistics metrics using Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`).  
It includes visualizations for:
- Average shipment delay by supplier  
- Average delivery time by treatment type  
- Total lead time by wood type  
- Weekly order volume

All charts are generated in a [Jupyter Notebook](logistics_metrics.ipynb) and available in this repository.
